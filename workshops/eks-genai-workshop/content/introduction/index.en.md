# Introduction

Welcome to the frontier of artificial intelligence on Kubernetes! This workshop represents the convergence of two transformative technologies: **Generative AI** and **Amazon EKS**. Together, they enable you to build scalable AI systems that can transform how organizations work.

## üåü Why GenAI on EKS?

The explosion of Large Language Models has created unprecedented opportunities - and challenges. Organizations need to:

- **Deploy models efficiently** while controlling costs
- **Scale dynamically** based on demand
- **Maintain security** and compliance
- **Monitor performance** and quality
- **Integrate seamlessly** with existing systems

Amazon EKS provides an excellent platform for these requirements, offering:

## üéØ Workshop Philosophy

This workshop follows three core principles:

### 1. **Learn by Doing** üõ†Ô∏è
Every concept is immediately reinforced with hands-on exercises. You won't just read about LLMs - you'll deploy them, optimize them, and build applications with them.

### 2. **Enterprise-First** üè≠
We use real enterprise patterns from day one. The techniques you learn here are the same ones used by leading AI companies and AWS customers worldwide.

### 3. **Progressive Complexity** üìà
We start with simple model deployment and gradually build to sophisticated multi-agent systems. Each module prepares you for the next level of complexity.

## üèóÔ∏è What We're Building

Throughout this workshop, you'll construct a complete GenAI platform with these capabilities:

### **Model Serving Layer**
- Self-hosted models on AWS Neuron hardware
- Integration with AWS Bedrock managed services
- Unified API access through LiteLLM
- Automatic failover and load balancing

### **Application Layer**
- Intelligent agents with reasoning capabilities
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Memory stores for context persistence
- Tool integration via Model Context Protocol

### **Operations Layer**
- Comprehensive observability with Langfuse
- Cost tracking and optimization
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Security and compliance controls

## üîç What Sets This Workshop Apart?

### **Comprehensive Coverage**
From infrastructure to applications, we cover the entire GenAI stack on Kubernetes.

### **Current Technology**
Work with the latest models and frameworks (LangChain, MCP).

### **AWS Integration**
Leverage AWS-specific optimizations like Neuron chips and Bedrock services.

### **Enterprise Patterns**
Learn patterns used by AWS customers running GenAI at scale.

### **Hands-On Experience**
Over 20 practical exercises with immediate feedback.
