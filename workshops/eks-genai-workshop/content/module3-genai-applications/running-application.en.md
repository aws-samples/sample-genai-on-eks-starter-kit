*John's application is waiting - let's process it with AI!*

## ✅ Prerequisites Check

Before we deploy, let's make sure your GenAI platform from Modules 1 & 2 is ready:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Check your platform components are running
kubectl get pods -n litellm
kubectl get pods -n langfuse

# Verify LiteLLM gateway is accessible
echo "LiteLLM URL: http://$(kubectl get ingress -n litellm litellm -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')"

# Check Langfuse observability
echo "Langfuse URL: http://$(kubectl get ingress -n langfuse langfuse -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')"
:::

::alert[**Platform Required**: All pods should show "Running" status. If any components are missing, please complete Modules 1 & 2 first.]{type="warning"}

## 🔧 Step 1: Configure Your Deployment

### Retrieve Your Platform Credentials

First, let's make sure you have your Virtual Key from Module 2:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Check if you have your AGENT_KEY from Module 2
if [ -z "$AGENT_KEY" ]; then
  echo "❌ AGENT_KEY not found. Please set it from Module 2"
  echo "Run: export AGENT_KEY='your-sk-key-from-module-2'"
else
  echo "✅ AGENT_KEY found: ${AGENT_KEY:0:10}..."
fi
:::

::alert[**Missing AGENT_KEY?** Go back to Module 2, Step 3 of the Virtual Key section and copy your key. Then run: `export AGENT_KEY="sk-your-actual-key"`]{type="warning"}

### Set Up All Required Keys

Now let's set up all the credentials needed for Loan Buddy:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Load your environment file to get Langfuse keys
source .env

# Verify all required keys are present
echo "Checking required credentials..."
[ ! -z "$LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY" ] && echo "✅ LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY found" || echo "❌ LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY missing"
[ ! -z "$LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY" ] && echo "✅ LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY found" || echo "❌ LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY missing"
[ ! -z "$AGENT_KEY" ] && echo "✅ AGENT_KEY found" || echo "❌ AGENT_KEY missing"
:::

### Update the Deployment Configuration

Now let's configure Loan Buddy to connect to your platform:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Open the deployment file
code /workshop/workshops/eks-genai-workshop/static/code/module3/credit-validation/agentic-application-deployment.yaml
:::

**Update these environment variables in the deployment file:**

::alert[**Use Your AGENT_KEY**: Replace `YOUR_LITELLM_API_KEY` with the value from your `$AGENT_KEY` environment variable (the Virtual Key you created in Module 2, Step 9)]{type="warning"}

1. Find the `loan-buddy-agent` deployment section
2. Update these values:
   ```yaml
   - name: LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY
     value: "YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLIC_KEY"  # Replace with value from $LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY
   - name: LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY  
     value: "YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY"  # Replace with value from $LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY
   - name: GATEWAY_MODEL_ACCESS_KEY
     value: "YOUR_LITELLM_API_KEY"    # Replace with value from $AGENT_KEY
   ```

3. Also update in the `mcp-image-processor` deployment:
   ```yaml
   - name: GATEWAY_MODEL_ACCESS_KEY
     value: "YOUR_LITELLM_API_KEY"    # Same value from $AGENT_KEY
   ```

**Tip:** You can echo your keys to copy them:
:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
echo "LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY: $LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"
echo "LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY: $LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"
echo "AGENT_KEY: $AGENT_KEY"
:::

::alert[**Important**: Save the file (Ctrl+S) after making these changes!]{type="warning"}

::alert[**Configuration Complete!** Your deployment file is now configured with all the necessary credentials from Module 2.]{type="success"}

## 🎯 Step 2: Deploy the AI Workforce

### Create the Workshop Namespace

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Create a dedicated namespace for Loan Buddy
kubectl create namespace workshop
:::

### Deploy All Components

Now let's deploy our AI assembly line:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Deploy Loan Buddy and all MCP servers
kubectl apply -f /workshop/workshops/eks-genai-workshop/static/code/module3/credit-validation/agentic-application-deployment.yaml

# Watch the magic happen!
echo "🚀 Deploying your AI workforce..."
echo "📸 Image Processor MCP - Ready to read documents"
echo "🏠 Address Validator MCP - Ready to verify addresses"
echo "💼 Employment Validator MCP - Ready to check backgrounds"
echo "🤖 Loan Processing Agent - Ready to orchestrate!"
:::

### Wait for Deployment to Complete

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Check deployment status
kubectl rollout status deployment/loan-buddy-agent -n workshop
kubectl rollout status deployment/mcp-address-validator -n workshop
kubectl rollout status deployment/mcp-employment-validator -n workshop
kubectl rollout status deployment/mcp-image-processor -n workshop

# Verify all pods are running
kubectl get pods -n workshop
:::

**Expected output - all pods should be "Running":**
```
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
loan-buddy-agent-xxx                     1/1     Running   0          1m
mcp-address-validator-xxx                1/1     Running   0          1m
mcp-employment-validator-xxx             1/1     Running   0          1m
mcp-image-processor-xxx                  1/1     Running   0          1m
```

## 🎬 Step 3: Watch the AI in Action

### Set Up Real-Time Monitoring

Open a second terminal to watch the agent's thought process:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# In a NEW terminal, watch the agent logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/loan-buddy-agent -n workshop
:::

**Keep this terminal visible** - you'll see the AI making decisions in real-time!

### Expose the Application

Back in your main terminal:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Make Loan Buddy accessible
kubectl port-forward service/loan-buddy-agent 8080:8080 -n workshop &

# Navigate to the test data directory
cd /workshop/workshops/eks-genai-workshop/static/code/module3/credit-validation/
:::

## 🎉 Step 4: Process John's Loan Application!

### The Big Moment - Submit John's Application

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Process John Michael Doe's loan application
curl -X POST -F "image_file=@./example1.png" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/process_credit_application_with_upload \
  | (data=$(cat); echo "$data" | jq -C 'del(.credit_assessment) + {"credit_assessment": "(formatted below)"}'; echo -e "\n\033[1;36m═══ CREDIT ASSESSMENT ═══\033[0m\n"; echo "$data" | jq -r '.credit_assessment' | sed 's/\\n/\n/g')
:::

### Watch the Magic Happen! ✨

**In your log terminal, you'll see:**

```

  "image_id": "a7b9c2d4e5f6...",
  "credit_assessment": "APPROVED - John Michael Doe's application for $8,500 home improvement loan is approved. Verified employment at Tech Solutions Inc ($75,000/year), confirmed residential address ownership, excellent debt-to-income ratio of 4.4%.",
  "processing_note": "Complete audit trail available in Langfuse"
}
```

## 📊 Step 5: Explore the Complete Workflow in Langfuse

### Open Langfuse Dashboard

1. **Get your Langfuse URL** (from the prerequisites check)
2. **Open it in your browser**
3. **Navigate to "Traces"** in the left sidebar

### Find John's Application Trace

Look for traces with:
- **Name**: `credit_underwriting_agent_with_image_id`
- **Recent timestamp** (just processed)

### What You'll See in the Trace

![Langfuse Trace Example](/static/images/module-3/LoanBuddy-Observability.png)
*Complete visibility into the AI's decision-making process*

**The trace shows:**
- 📊 **Complete workflow** - Every step from upload to decision
- 🔧 **All tool calls** - Image extraction, address validation, employment verification
- 💭 **AI reasoning** - Why the loan was approved
- ⏱️ **Performance metrics** - Processing time, latency for each step
- 💰 **Cost tracking** - Tokens used, estimated cost
- 📝 **Full audit trail** - Complete record for compliance

### Analyze the Metrics

In Langfuse, click on the trace to see:
- **Total tokens**: ~2,500 tokens used
- **Processing time**: 45-60 seconds total
- **Tool calls**: 3 MCP servers invoked
- **Decision path**: Complete reasoning chain

## 🎯 Step 6: Try Different Scenarios (Optional)

### Test with the Second Application

If you have another test application:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Process another application
curl -X POST -F "image_file=@./example2.png" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/process_credit_application_with_upload
:::

### Experiment with Edge Cases

Try modifying the MCP server mock data to see different outcomes:
- What if employment verification fails?
- What if the address is invalid?
- What if the income doesn't match?

## 🎊 WOOHOO! You Did It!

### What Just Happened?

You've successfully:
- ✅ **Deployed** a complete AI loan processing system on Kubernetes
- ✅ **Processed** John's loan application in under a minute
