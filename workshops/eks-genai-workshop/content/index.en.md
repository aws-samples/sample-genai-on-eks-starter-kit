---

Welcome to a comprehensive hands-on GenAI workshop on Amazon EKS! Over the next few hours, you'll build a complete generative AI platform - from deploying your first LLM to creating intelligent applications.

## 🏗️ Built on Proven Foundation

This workshop is built on the **[AWS GenAI on EKS Starter Kit](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-genai-on-eks-starter-kit)** - a comprehensive reference architecture for deploying GenAI platforms on Amazon EKS.

**After the workshop**, you can:
- Deploy the same patterns in your own AWS account using the starter kit
- Customize the platform for your specific use cases
- Scale to handle thousands of AI requests with confidence
- Leverage battle-tested Kubernetes configurations

::alert[**Take It Home**: Everything you build today can be deployed in your own environment using the open-source starter kit!]{type="success"}

## 🎯 What Makes This Workshop Special?

This isn't just another "Hello World" AI tutorial. You'll work with:

- **GenAI Platform** built on EKS Auto Mode
- **Real LLMs** including Qwen 3 8b & DeepSeek R1 Qwen 3 8b running on AWS Neuron chips and Claude 3.7 via Amazon Bedrock
- **Modern AI Patterns** for observability, cost tracking, and scalability
- **Cutting-edge frameworks** like LangChain, LangGraph, and Model Context Protocol
- **Hands-on exercises** that mirror real-world GenAI deployments

## 📚 Module Overview

### Module 1: Interacting with Models
**From Zero to AI Chat in Minutes**

You'll start by interacting with Large Language Models through different deployment patterns:

- 💬 **Open WebUI** - Deploy a ChatGPT-like interface for model interaction
- ⚡ **vLLM on AWS Neuron** - Host Qwen 3 8b & DeepSeek R1 Qwen 3 8b on Neuron
- ☁️ **AWS Bedrock Integration** - Connect to Claude 3.7 and GPT OSS 20b via Amazon Bedrock

::alert[**Hands-on Focus**: You'll get to use real models deployed on EKS and see immediate results - no simulation or mocking!]{type="success"}

### Module 2: GenAI Platform Components
**Building Your AI Infrastructure**

Transform individual components into a unified platform:
